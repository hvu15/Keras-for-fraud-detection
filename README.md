# Deep Learning Keras for Fraud Detection

Application of the deep learning Keras to Bitcoin graph data set on Kaggle: [Elliptic Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/ellipticco/elliptic-data-set)

The dataset was split into training set and test set with 80% for training and 20% for testing.
After splitting the dataset, StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing was applied to normalize the data before training for the deep learning Keras model.

To evaluate performance, the accuracy score was calculated.

A visualization of the model accuracy and model loss was created at the end.
